Smart Contracts that allow you to use Flash Loans!

## What are Flash Loans?
A Flash Loan is a type of Crypto Loan that is only valid within a single transaction. Essentially this means that the currency is borrowed, used, and returned in the same contract. If the money isn't returned, the transaction is reverted and never actually goes through. This essentially allows you to borrow a large amount of money with **no collateral**!
